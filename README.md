## Hi, I’m Amanda

✨ Currently looking for a full-time role. ✨

I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience. I’ve shipped sites for Marvel Snap, the Golden Globes, Wizards of the Coast, and many more!

Most of my work is in private repos (mostly GitLab), but if you're interested in how I write code, you can check out my [portfolio repo]([https://mandamcneal.com](https://github.com/venerated/mandamcneal.com)).

My philosiphy when it comes to developent is "build sites that you'd want to use," meaning that empathy is my north star. That means I care about things like performance and accessibility.
